apply_levels:
  name: Apply Logger Levels
  description: The preferred way to manage Home Assistant logging levels. Use this service instead of Developer Tools → Actions → logger.set_level for better tracking and management. View currently managed loggers in the sensor.logger_manager_state entity. Note that Home Assistant accepts any logger name, including invalid/non-existent ones. Invalid loggers can be removed by setting them to the default level.
